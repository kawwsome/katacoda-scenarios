Just like we would use the `ls` command to list files and directories, we can use similar tools that list information about devices.

**Listing USB Devices**

```
$ lsusb
```

**Listing PCI Devices**

```
$ lspci
```

**Listing SCSI Devices**

```
$ lsscsi
```

**Listing block devices**

```
$ lsblk
```

## Exercise

Try out each of these commands and see the output you receive.
