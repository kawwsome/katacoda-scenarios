For this ritual, we will be casting a magic circle.

I used an ethernet cable to cast the shape of the circle, and placed four technological artifacts in the four cardinal corners, each one representing one of the four elements.

# North; Earth

In the North was placed a hard drive. The hard drive is a symbol of permanence and stability; an actual chunk of magnetism holding our history within it.

As such, it represented **Earth**.

# East; Air

In the East we placed a Wi-Fi router. The router casts and draws radio waves from the ether to gather information from the far reaches and bring them into our home; like the scents of the outside being carried in by the wind. It is a vessel of information and thought, holding the things that cannot be seen but can be easily considered and described.

As such, it represented **Air**. 

# South; Fire

In the South we placed a coiled up power cord. Coursing with electricity, the cord gives energy to our devices before we know what this energy should be used for. It is a wild, seductive, and creative power that holds as much danger as it does potential.

As such, it represented **Fire**.

# West; Water

In the West we placed layered pieces of blue and yellow paper on which we'd written [*HTML*](https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/The-Web-as-a-Language-What-No-One-Ever-Told-You-About-HTML-That-You-Didn't-Know-to-Ask).

In a prior magic circle, I had made up these notes with some standard markup for any page, and left the `<title>` and `<body>` tags blank. People could then fill these in to describe the webpage they'd like to visit on the Internet.

With these written, we now had a layering of dreamed of sites. They represent the poetic dream of the Internet, an area whose depth we cannot fully understand, that cannot be easily structured or described as each part shifts and connects to the other in continually fluid ways.

At its best, the Web is an ocean of emotions and connections and the dreams of the heart.

As such, it represented **Water**.

# Within the circle

Within this circle was placed two yellow candles along with artifacts the members had brought that represented magic and technology to them: a [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org/), a pair of eye glasses, stickers from a Pittsburgh coven that had invisibility spells woven into them, and a seashell filled with smoldering, aromatic mugwort.

With a message of thanks to the people gathered and the elements and space that allowed us to be here, I began the guided ritual.

(And by &ldquo;began&rdquo; I mean that I first thanked everyone for patience and being good sports, as this was my first time trying this and felt foolish and nervous but like it was worth it. With that needless insecurity out of the way, I started.)
