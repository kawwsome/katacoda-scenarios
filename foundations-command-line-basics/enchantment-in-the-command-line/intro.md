Hello.

We&rsquo;re very excited that you&rsquo;re here.

By showing up, you are making your first moves towards a better understanding of your computer. If you continue on this path, you&rsquo;ll soon be able to use your computer in a more fulfilling way. And though you may find the journey difficult at parts, you might just discover that the endlessness of this journey is its most fulfilling aspect.

Welcome to the *Solarpunk Magic Computer Club&rsquo;s Enchantment Ritual*.

# Intent

This ritual casts an enchantment on your computer and the work you do within it. The purpose of the enchantment is to re-orient yourself with your technology, so you have better support as you begin to explore working in code.

This ritual is intended for folks new to coding and the command line, but I think it has value to experienced folks as well. Basically, if you feel disenchanted, perform this ritual (or some modification of it) to enchant yourself again.

Here, I detail one version of what we often do and say at our rituals. My hope is by sharing the experience, you are inspired to try something yourself and can use these words to structure your own practice. It isn&rsquo;t meant as an instruction manual; simply a description of an event that you could try some version of yourself!

Ready? Let&rsquo;s begin.
